        <p>I am Amy Duke, a Professional Muay Thai athlete representing New York City that competes against top athletes
          in the World.</p>
          
          <p>I began my fighting journey in 2016 in Chiang Mai, Thailand where I had my first 5 fights. After 7 months, my fiance and I returned to Florida where I fought a few times before we decided to relocate to Brooklyn in order to chase big fights and high level training.</p>
          
          <p> I began training under Phil Nurse at the Wat in 2017. I won my first championship in July of 2018. Since
            relocating to New York, Iâ€™ve captured 5 titles including the first ever women's WBC Muaythai National US
            Amateur Super Flyweight Title at 115lbs.</p>
            
            <p> In 2022, I was invited to compete on the Emmy Award Nominated reality television series, The Challenger:
              Battleground, where I made my pro debut. </p>
